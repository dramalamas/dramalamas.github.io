Title : POST / ERA
Self initiated project
The exhibition prepared for the Institute of Design in Kielce, addressing the theme of the poster as a graphical medium subjected to severe criticism by contemporary design critics. From the text promoting the exhibition: &quot;In a comic strip, which consists of a series of three-color posters, we decided to portray the terms of the poster culture / culture in Poland. In this way we add our three pennies to the big conversation, which as hiccups is reflected in the media related to graphics / design. The dispute over the poster is eternal - we are here for a moment &quot;

Title: NEVER FOREVER NEVER FOR NOW 
Bio:
the luxury of protest is the nom de guerre of london-based designer and artist peter crnokrak. established in 2009, the practice is an experimental design platform that develops both commercial and critical design projects that transcend traditional reference points of purpose and authorship within the profession. projects are concept driven and utilize design language to communicate meaning in complex systems. the practice is a continual crossover between art, design and new technologies with work that addresses culturally relevant themes including geopolitics, generative aesthetics and the integration of science and art.

the luxury of protest has been featured in over 100 books and magazines, has had work exhibited in london, berlin, tokyo and new york, and has won a number of international design competitions including aiga 365, istd and the european design awards. in 2010, peter was made a fellow of the royal society of arts in recognition of award winning expertise in design and data visualisation.
